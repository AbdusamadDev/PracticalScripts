The chart below illustrates number of visitors visiting a particular Caribbean island in 
different categories between 2010 and 2017

Clearly, the total number of visitors set high percentages in the chart. Both visitors 
staying on cruise ships and staying on island show lower and more similar percentages rather
than total number of visitors showed. Over the years, the percentage of overall tourists
increased gradually. At early stages, one million of tourists visited the island while 
half of tourists were staying on cruise ships, and about 25 percent of visitors stayed on
island and enjoyed the scene of Carribean island. Next year, those percentages slightly 
got higher, increased to about 250000 people more. At that time, half million of people 
began to stay on cruise. However the number of visitors staying on island didn't grow or lower
at all. And over the years until 2015, total number of tourists growed gradually. Every year
the island gained half million of people and the amount of tourists went the same after 
increasing to 0.25 million of total population of tourists in 2015. And in 2012, the number of visitors staying on cruise ships fell dramatically and got higher and higher about 0.25 - 0.5 million of visitor growing interval every year. But we can see that in the years between 2012 - 2016 the number of visitors who were staying on mind-blowing and historical island was already higher than one million and didn't grow higher than 1.5 million. After that, the fraction lowered little bit in 2016, to 0.25 million in numbers and again gained 0.25 million of tourists in 2017. And we can see significant grows in 2017. The exotic island attracted about 3.5 million tourists.
