To update your code, I will integrate the improvements discussed earlier. This includes enhanced error handling for permission issues, ensuring the script runs with the necessary privileges, and managing mount points more safely. The updated script will attempt to create a mount point if it doesn't exist and will use sudo for operations that require elevated privileges.

Here's the revised code:

python
Copy code
import pyudev
import requests
import os

context = pyudev.Context()
monitor = pyudev.Monitor.from_netlink(context)
monitor.filter_by(subsystem='block', device_type='partition')

def check_for_file(device):
    mount_point = f"/mnt/{device.device_node.split('/')[-1]}"

    # Create mount point if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(mount_point):
        os.system(f"sudo mkdir -p {mount_point}")

    # Check if the device is already mounted; if not, mount it
    if not os.path.ismount(mount_point):
        os.system(f"sudo mount {device.device_node} {mount_point}")

    # Check for 'text.txt'
    if os.path.exists(f"{mount_point}/text.txt"):
        print(f"text.txt found in {device.device_node}")
    else:
        print(f"text.txt not found in {device.device_node}")

    # Unmount the device
    os.system(f"sudo umount {mount_point}")

print("Starting to monitor for USB devices...")
for device in iter(monitor.poll, None):
    if device.action == 'add':
        print(f"Device added: {device.device_node}")
        check_for_file(device)
        response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/")
        print(response.json())
Important Notes:
Run with Sudo: You should run this script with sudo to ensure it has the necessary permissions for creating directories, mounting, and unmounting devices:

Copy code
sudo python3 your_script.py
Permissions and Security: Be aware that running scripts with sudo can be a security risk, especially if the script's behavior is not fully controlled. Make sure you understand the implications.

Handling Mount Points: The script attempts to mount the device under /mnt/. Ensure this path is suitable for your system.

Networking Requests: The script makes a request to a local server. Make sure the server is running and accessible at the specified URL.

Please let me know if you need any further modifications or have specific requirements for your environment.

User
write code that it should access into the folder called:

media/<a indexed digit from 1 to the length of number of files>/main.jpg and details.txt


and it should iterate over the folders in the media folder and request to http://localhost:8000/api/criminals/ [POST], and send the details in the text file as dict to the api and inside the context dictionary, image key should send the image called main.jpg which is located at target folder
GPT
To write a Python script that iterates over folders in a media directory, accesses files named main.jpg and details.txt in each folder, and then sends a POST request to an API with the contents of details.txt and the image main.jpg, you can follow these steps:

Iterate Over Folders: Use os and glob modules to iterate over the folders in the media directory.

Read Details and Image: For each folder, read the details.txt file to get the details, and open the image main.jpg.

Send POST Request: Use the requests library to send a POST request to your API with the details and the image.

Here is the Python script to accomplish this:

python
Copy code
import os
import glob
import requests

def post_data(folder_path):
    details_path = os.path.join(folder_path, 'details.txt')
    image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, 'main.jpg')

    # Read details from the text file
    with open(details_path, 'r') as file:
        details = file.read()

    # Convert details to dictionary (assuming it's in a key:value format)
    details_dict = dict(line.split(':') for line in details.splitlines())

    # Open the image file
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as img_file:
        files = {'image': img_file}
        response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/api/criminals/', data=details_dict, files=files)
        print(response.status_code, response.json())

# Iterate over folders in the media directory
media_path = 'media'
for i, folder in enumerate(glob.glob(os.path.join(media_path, '*')), start=1):
    if os.path.isdir(folder):
        post_data(folder)
Important Notes:
File Format: This script assumes that the details.txt file contains data in a key-value format, separated by colons (e.g., name:John Doe).

API Endpoint: Ensure that the endpoint http://localhost:8000/api/criminals/ is correct and the server is running.

Error Handling: You might want to add error handling for file reading and API request failures.

Folder Structure: This script assumes a specific folder structure under media. If the structure is different, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

Image and Text File: The script assumes that every folder contains main.jpg and details.txt. If any of these files are missing, the script will throw an error.

API Authentication: If your API requires authentication, you'll need to modify the requests.post call to include the necessary headers or authentication tokens.

Before running this script, make sure you have the requests library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install it using pip:

bash
