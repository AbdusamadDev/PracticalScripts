It appears that you have successfully installed aiogram version 3.1.1, which is a newer version than the one I provided code for. The executor module does not exist in aiogram 3.x, as there have been significant changes in how bots are created and run in this version.

To run the bot with aiogram 3.x, you need to modify the code structure. Here's an updated version of the bot script tailored for aiogram 3.x:

python
Copy code
from aiogram import Bot, Router, types
from aiogram.dispatcher.fsm.context import FSMContext
from aiogram.dispatcher.fsm.state import State, StatesGroup
from aiogram.dispatcher.middlewares import BaseMiddleware
from aiogram.types import InlineKeyboardMarkup, InlineKeyboardButton
from aiogram.utils import executor
import asyncio

API_TOKEN = 'your_bot_token_here'
ADMIN_ID = 'legion5565'  # Admin's username

bot = Bot(token=API_TOKEN)
router = Router()

# Database or in-memory storage for demo purposes
# In a real-world scenario, use a proper database
subscriptions = {}


@router.message(commands=['start'])
async def send_welcome(message: types.Message):
    # Greeting message and subscription prompt
    keyboard = InlineKeyboardMarkup()
    subscribe_button = InlineKeyboardButton("Subscribe", callback_data="subscribe")
    keyboard.add(subscribe_button)
    await message.answer("Hello! Please subscribe to our channel: t.me/sukunatl1gim", reply_markup=keyboard)


@router.callback_query(text="subscribe")
async def process_callback_subscribe(callback_query: types.CallbackQuery):
    # Handle subscription
    subscriptions[callback_query.from_user.id] = asyncio.get_event_loop().time() + 24 * 3600  # 24 hours from now
    await callback_query.answer("You've subscribed for 24 hours!")

    # In real scenario, prompt user to join the channel and monitor channel membership

    # Schedule a task to notify admin after 24 hours
    asyncio.create_task(notify_admin_after_24_hours(callback_query.from_user.id))


async def notify_admin_after_24_hours(user_id):
    await asyncio.sleep(24 * 3600)  # Wait for 24 hours
    if user_id in subscriptions and asyncio.get_event_loop().time() > subscriptions[user_id]:
        # Notify the admin to remove the user
        await bot.send_message(ADMIN_ID, f"Subscription expired for user {user_id}. Please remove them from the channel.")
        del subscriptions[user_id]  # Remove from subscription list

if __name__ == '__main__':
    executor.start_polling(router)
This code is adapted for the latest aiogram version. Make sure to replace 'your_bot_token_here' with your actual bot token.

Note: The new aiogram 3.x has different paradigms for creating and handling bots, so it's crucial to follow the updated structure. The documentation for aiogram 3.x can provide more detailed guidance on using this version effectively.

It looks like you're facing an issue where the Python interpreter is using the global site-packages directory instead of the local site-packages directory within your virtual environment. This can happen due to several reasons. Let's troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Ensure Virtual Environment is Activated
First, ensure that your virtual environment is activated. When activated, the command prompt should show the virtual environment's name, as in your case, it should be (vevn).

If it's not activated, activate it using:

bash
Copy code
source /home/legion/Projects/coding/vevn/bin/activate
Check Python Interpreter
After activating the virtual environment, check which Python interpreter is being used:

bash
Copy code
which python
This command should point to the Python interpreter in your virtual environment (.../vevn/bin/python). If it doesn't, there's an issue with how the virtual environment is set up or being activated.

Reinstall aiogram in the Virtual Environment
Make sure that aiogram is installed in the virtual environment and not globally:

Activate your virtual environment.

Use pip to install aiogram:

bash
Copy code
pip install aiogram
Check Your PYTHONPATH
Ensure that the PYTHONPATH environment variable doesn't include paths that could interfere with your virtual environment. You can print and inspect it using:

bash
Copy code
echo $PYTHONPATH
If you see paths that are not related to your virtual environment, you may want to unset or modify the PYTHONPATH.

Check for Conflicting Python Configurations
Sometimes, Python configurations in .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc (depending on your shell) can interfere with how virtual environments are handled. Check these files for any Python-related configurations that might be causing issues.

Recreate the Virtual Environment
If the above steps don't work, you might want to recreate the virtual environment:

Deactivate and remove the existing virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
rm -rf /home/legion/Projects/coding/vevn
User
(vevn) legion@LittleKid:~/Projects/coding$ echo $PYTHONPATH

(vevn) legion@LittleKid:~/Projects/coding$

It looks like your PYTHONPATH is not set, which is generally a good thing when working with virtual environments, as it means there's less risk of interference from global Python settings. Since PYTHONPATH is not the issue, let's move on to other steps to ensure your virtual environment is functioning correctly.

Verify aiogram Installation in Virtual Environment
Check aiogram Installation: First, let's make sure that aiogram is indeed installed in your virtual environment. While your virtual environment is active, run:

bash
Copy code
pip list | grep aiogram
This command will show if aiogram is installed and its version. If it's not listed, install it with pip install aiogram.

Python Interpreter Path: Check the path of the Python interpreter to ensure you're using the one from your virtual environment. Run:

bash
Copy code
which python
This should point to the Python interpreter within your vevn directory.

Try Running Your Script Again
If the above checks are all correct, try running your Python script again with the virtual environment activated. Make sure you're in the correct directory where your script is located.

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Additional Checks
If it still doesn't work, consider these additional checks:

Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions in the directory where your virtual environment and project are located.

Python Version: Verify that
